# Screenshot Fuzzy Search

## Introduction

If you're constantly taking screenshots of errors, terrible code and passive aggressive emails, this is the tool for you! `sfzs` allows you to index, search and tag your system screenshots easily though the cli. Next time someone asks you about an error you've seen before simply `sfzs 'some stupid error string'` to find all matching screenshots, allowing you to brag to your coworkers that you successfully created this error before them. Furthermore, you can tag that error with some reminder or information `sfzs tag id 'DO NOT DO THIS AGAIN'`.

## Installation
